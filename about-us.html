    <h3>Here will be a meme slideshow!</h3>
    <p>
      We're currently working on a meme slideshow that will be placed right here! This paragraph is only for the layout to see whether the rest of the content will look good with it!

        <h3>About us</h3>
        <p>We’re group of students who love memes as much as programming but since we’re just starting our journey in Web Development this project may take some time to be finished! So, we’re encourage you to gather the most intriguing questions about memes for the grand reveal of this project. </p>

        <h3>Group Members</h3>
        <p>
            <p><a href="https://github.com/jozumate">Konrad</a> – scrum master or, in the non-programming world, our Dear Leader. That one guy who will be fired if something doesn’t work properly during grand reveal.</p>
            <p><a href="https://github.com/pomaranskak">Katarzyna</a> – right hand of the scrum master. She’s the one who wants to have the work done properly and won’t let you sleep until your task IS DONE.</p>
            <p><a href="https://github.com/WiktoriaOstrowska3009">Wiktoria</a> – specialist from API. There’s some rumours she is the actual database of this chatbot.</p>
            <p><a href="https://github.com/SeeVv">Sebastian</a> – specialist from responsiveness. Most of the time doesn’t know what he’s doing, so if the MemeBot2021 doesn’t work properly on your phone, that means that Seba has been playing Dota for the past week and ignoring Katarzyna’s texts. <s>We’re all have that one person in the group.</s></p>
